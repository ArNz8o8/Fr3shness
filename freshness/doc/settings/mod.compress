                               Compress Module


  This module provides provides support for file compression. It can be used
  to compress files via Tcl or to transfer the userfile compressed during the
  share process, saving bandwidth.

    This module requires: share

  Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the compress
  module:

    loadmodule compress

  There are also some variables you can set in your config file:

    set share-compressed 1
        Allow compressed sending of user files? The user files are compressed
        with the compression level defined in `compress-level'.

    set compress-level 9
      This is the default compression level used. These levels are the same
      as those used by GNU gzip.
